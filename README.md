# chinese word segmentation

# structure

* BM.py: bidirectional match
* BMM.py:  backward maximum match
* FMM.py:  forward maximum match
* make_dict.py: import the word dictionary
* metrics.py:  compute the precision, recall, f1-score
* segment_main.py: run the experiment

## results

* results.txt: a raw sentence has two corresponding lines, and the first is segmentation result, the second is the [precision, recall, f1-score]
* result.png: runntime, average experiment results
